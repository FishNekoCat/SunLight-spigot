# SunLight
SunLight is a all-in-one plugin solution for your Spigot server! It tries to provide you all the most essential features every modern server must have. And not only that, but also a lot of customizations and configurations. The plugin is modularized, so you can easily completely disable any part you don't like.

# Distinctive Features
While this plugin aims to replace multiple other plugins, please, don't expect that it will act the same way as other plugins do.

## Commands
You may notice, that most of the plugin command aliases are not equal to common ones you used to use in other plugins (e.g. EssentialsX, MaxBans, Multiworld, etc.). And yes, this is intentional, because SunLight uses its own command structure and organization. However, there is an option to create your own shortcuts for the plugin commands.
